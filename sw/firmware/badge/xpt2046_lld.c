/*
 * This module implements support for the Shenzen XPTEK XPT2046 4-wire
 * resistive touch screen controller chip. The XPT2046 provides a SPI
 * 4-wite SPI interface and includes a set of ADC blocks for performing
 * sensing with resistive touch units. It provides X, Y and X axis
 * readings as well as a temperature sensor. Commands are sent as a
 * single 8-bit transaction and responses are received as either an 8
 * bit or 16 bit transaction. Sendsor readings are returned as 12-bit
 * quantities.

*
* xptGet - issue command to XPT2046 chip and return result
*
* This function issues a command to the XPT2046 chip and returns a result.
* The command is an instruction to sample a value from one of the ADC
* channels. Sensor results can be returned as either 8-bit or 12-bit values.
* This function always requests 12-bit results. Valid commands are be:
*
* XPT_CHAN_X		X axis position
* XPT_CHAN_Y		Y axis position
* XPT_CHAN_Z1           Z1 pressure sense
* XPT_CHAN_Z2           Z2 pressure sense
* XPT_CHAN_VBAT		battery voltage
* XPT_CHAN_TEMP0        temperature sensor
* XPT_CHAN_TEMP1        temperature sensor
*
* The chip is kept powered down between readings to conserve power.
*
* RETURNS: 16-bit sensor value for X, Y or Z axis, or temperature reading
